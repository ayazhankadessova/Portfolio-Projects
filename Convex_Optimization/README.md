# Convex_Optimization

In this project, I gained hands-on experience in implementing performance measures using Gradient Descent Methods. I explored how to optimize the algorithm's efficiency by studying the influence of different learning rates. Additionally, I utilized the Simplex Algorithm to identify optimal values, further enhancing my skills in mathematical optimization.
